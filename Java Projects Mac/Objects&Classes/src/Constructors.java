/* Constructor is a special type of method
 * Its special because
 * (1) must have the same name as the Class
 * 	 -- you can have multiple constructors, but they still have to have the same name as the Class
 * 	 -- you can distinguish them by adding arguments 
 * 	 -- Constructors do not have return types but if you add a VOID to it, you essentially have a normal method 
 * 	 -- 
 * 
 * --Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods
 * --Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclasses.
 * 		-- So what that means is a class that is declared with abstract KEYWORD, is known as abstract class
 * (2)
