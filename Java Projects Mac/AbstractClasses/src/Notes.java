 * Abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
 * Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user
 * 	--> In other words the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
 * 
 * 	--> A class which contains the keyword ABSTRACT in its declaration is known as a abstract class
 * 	--> Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods i.e. methods without body (public void ();)
 * 	--> But, if a class has at least one abstract methods, then the class must be declared abstract
 * 	--> if a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated 
 * 			--instantiated: have an instance
